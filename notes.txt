#extend the api to allow one to pass in the layers array
this allows it to be used as an API for a front end web framework
if we allow arc units then we can easily make deep simplicity interface
with an autograd system like jax

A. Ng Said go deep
Well you've got to start shallow first
Here's NN class from scratch using numpy :)
Don't worry there's way more cool things in this github

TODOS:
- different inits for different activations
	- https://towardsdatascience.com/weight-initialization-in-neural-networks-a-journey-from-the-basics-to-kaiming-954fb9b47c79

start date: Nov 7 8pm
checkpoint 1: accomplished on nov 8 6:14 pm :)
	finished: mse fwd and bwd working with relu 
		
		
checkpoint 2: nov 9
	finished CE softmax
	todo:
		- how to implement rswitch regularization (if it even means anything )
			- this will need training mode
			- and inference mode 
		- Adam
		- Stochastic gradient
